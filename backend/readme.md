# Backend Challenge

This challenge is part of the iOS hiring process at [Heart
Hands](https://hearthands.tech/).

## Why this challenge?

Heart Hands is operating with a small team of dedicated & talented people. We
are looking for seasoned engineers with a deep technical knowledge, strong
understanding of their technical stack, and excellent product intuitions to join
our team.

This exercise has been designed to give a glimpse of what it is like to build a
messaging app, and the kind of technical challenges we face and care about. We
know time is precious, and we are expecting you to spend no more than 48 hours
on this.

## Instructions

You are tasked with the implementation of the backend for a messaging app that
allows users to send and receive messages in private 1:1 chats.

You are being given one constraint: you must use Go. For the rest, you are free
to choose your data layer, network protocol, and design your API as you see fit.
You are purposefully being given a lot of freedom here, and you will not be
judged on these decisions alone, but we are expecting you to understand the
trade-offs you make.

## Requirements

What are we expecting you to build?

- [ ] Users should be able to authenticate with their phone numbers
- [ ] Users should be able to list all their ongoing chats
- [ ] Users should be able receive messages from other users
- [ ] Users should be able to send messages to other users

## Bonus

Some topics to look at to dive deeper:

- [ ] Users should be able to authenticate with their email address
- [ ] Add support for SMS forwarding to relay the messages to the users phone numbers
- [ ] Add support for Email forwarding to relay the messages to the users email addresses
- [ ] Make the backend idempotent in regards to what you receive
- [ ] Add support for a read/unread message status
- [ ] Users should be able to receive messages as they are sent

## What we look at

We know it's a short amount of time, and you will have to prioritize what you
spend time on. A few things that are important for us and that will be
considered during the review:
- collaboration: is the code easy to read, maintain, and evolve?
- features: what did you prioritize to maximize your impact?
- testability: is the code tested or easily testable?
- documentation: is the readme clear? are important parts of the code documented? can we follow your thought process with your commits?

Good luck, and enjoy!
