# Backend Challenge

This challenge is part of the iOS hiring process at [Heart
Hands](https://hearthands.tech/).

## Why this challenge?

Heart Hands is operating with a small team of dedicated & talented people. We
are looking for seasoned engineers with a deep technical knowledge, strong
understanding of their technical stack, and excellent product intuitions to join
our team.

This challenge has been designed to give a glimpse of what it is like to build a
messaging app, and the kind of technical challenges we face and care about. We
know time is precious, and we are expecting you to spend no more than 48 hours
on this.

## Summary

You are tasked with implementing the backend of a messaging app that allows
users to send and receive messages in private 1:1 chats.

The only constraint you are given is that you must use Go. For the rest, you are
free to choose your data layer, network protocol, and design your API as you see
fit. You are purposefully being given a lot of freedom here, and you will not be
judged on these decisions alone. But we are expecting you to understand the
trade-offs you make.

## Requirements

What are we expecting you to build?

- [ ] Users should be able to authenticate with their phone numbers
- [ ] Users should be able receive messages from other users
- [ ] Users should be able to send messages to other users

## Bonus

A few topics to look at if you want to dive deeper:

- [ ] Users should be able to authenticate with their email address
- [ ] Write tests that assert the functional scope of your server
- [ ] Add support for SMS forwarding to send the messages to the users phone numbers
- [ ] Add support for Email forwarding to send the messages to the users email addresses

## What we look at

We know it's a short amount of time, and you will have to prioritize what you
spend time on. A few things that are important for us and that we will consider
during the review:
- structure: is the code easy to maintain and easy to evolve?
- robustness: is the code tested (or testable, we don't expect 100% code
coverage here)
- documentation: is the readme clear and are important parts of the code documented?

Good luck, and enjoy!
