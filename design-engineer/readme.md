# Design Engineer Challenge

Welcome to the Heart Hands Design Engineer Challenge. We want to see your creativity, product instincts, strategic thinking, and technical skills in action.

This challenge is part of the hiring process for Design Engineers at [Heart Hands](https://hearthands.tech).

## Why this challenge?

We're a small, talented team seeking design engineers with strong technical abilities, product sense, and creativity. This challenge offers a glimpse into the impactful features we build and the challenges we tackle.

M1 is all about communication, and a key part of this is sharing call notes seamlessly across platforms. This challenge will test your ability to think beyond a single platform, delivering exceptional design and user experience while balancing functionality, strategic prioritization, and implementation.

We expect you to spend 4-6 hours on this challenge, simulating real-world, time-boxed work.

## Instructions

You are tasked with redesigning the call notes experience for the web, starting by designing the web view of a call note with sharing in mind.

### Requirements

- Write a proposal outlining your solution.
- Include your designs in the document with a link to Figma.
- Outline how you would measure success for your proposal.
- Describe the next steps, challenges to build, and how you would start bringing the prototype to life.

> **Note:** Donâ€™t feel tied to existing designs. While being aware of what exists is great for feature parity, we encourage creativity and introducing something new.


## Context

After a phone call, voice note, or Google Meet, users receive a detailed summary inside the app. They often want to do more with it, especially sharing the notes link with other participants who don't have M1 installed.

Currently, call notes on the web offer the bare minimum. The native iOS view is far more advanced in terms of features, but once shared outside of M1, new users are left with a subpar experience, missing out on M1â€™s magic!

We see this as a great opportunity to bring new users to the app, give them a taste of M1 on the web, and drive virality, as sharing notes is key to relaying information.

## Bonus

Prototype with code: If you have ideas that are better expressed through code than a static prototype, letâ€™s see them!

## Resources

We have prepared a Figma file containing some of our existing designs for you to copy or build upon!

## Challenge Review

Here are some key points that will be considered during the review:

- **Storytelling:** Your ability to articulate ideas and present them in a way that excites people and helps them understand your proposal.
- **Impact:** How would you measure success for this iteration? What data points would you look for after the release?
- **Prioritization:** What trade-offs did you make, and how did they drive your focus? What would you do if you had more time?
- **Evolution:** If the iteration performs well, how do you see the feature evolving? What theories or opinions does it help shape for you about the product?

Have fun building magic! ðŸŒ
