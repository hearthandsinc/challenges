# Design Engineer Challenge

This challenge is part of the Design Engineer hiring process at [Heart
Hands](https://hearthands.tech/).


## Why this challenge?

Heart Hands is a small team of passionate and talented individuals. We are looking for experienced design engineers with deep expertise in design systems, a strong understanding of design principles and tools, and excellent product instincts to join our team.

This challenge is designed to provide insight into what itâ€™s like to create intuitive, visually compelling interfaces for a call recording app, and the type of design challenges we tackle and care about. We expect you to spend between 4 and 6 hours on this challenge.


## Instructions

You are tasked to rethink the call notes experience outside the M1 iOS app. Starting by designing and coding a prototype of a web preview of a call summary with sharing in mind.

Requirements:

- [ ] A description of your approach and solution you came up with.
- [ ] One or multiple designed screens.
- [ ] A coded prototype that displays the call information, summary and actions.
- [ ] A description of what would be needed to bring this prototype to life. (backend requirements, iOS requirements)


## Context

After a call in M1, user receives a nice summary inside the app. They often want to do more with it, and especially they want to share the notes to the other participant that don't necessarily have M1 installed.

Today, call notes on the web are doing the absolute bare minimum, the native view on iOS is far more advanced in terms of feature set, but once shared out of M1, new users are left with a sub-par experience.

We identified this is a great opportunity to bring new users to the app. And as the scope of M1 will evolve with more products, sharing will become even more central.


## Bonus

Some topics that we find interesting to dig:

- [ ] How can we encourage users to share their summary?
- [ ] Make the summary view flexible to support different kind of sources (Voice Memo, Video Meeting, etc.)
- [ ] How will the summary look on different devices and environments.
- [ ] _Anything_ that you feel could improve the UX!


## Resources

We have prepared a figma file containing some of our existing designs so you can build upon it.

## Challenge Review

We know you only have a limited time alloted to deliver this challenge, and thus
will have to prioritize what you work on. A few things that are important for us
and that will be considered during the review:
- **descriptive**: are the approaches and choices clearly backed up by a description that the team can follow?
- **impact**: which features did you prioritize?
- **evolution**: can the project be smoothly taken to prod and/or iterated on?

Good luck, and enjoy!
